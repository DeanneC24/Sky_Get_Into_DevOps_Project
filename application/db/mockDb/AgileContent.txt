Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is based on the Agile Manifesto, a set of principles for software development that prioritize individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.

There are several popular methodologies within the Agile framework, including:

1. Scrum: A popular Agile framework that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. It involves short sprints, daily stand-up meetings, and frequent feedback cycles.

2. Kanban: A method of visualizing and managing work that emphasizes continuous delivery and continuous improvement. It involves a visual board that tracks work items, and limits work in progress to ensure that resources are not over-allocated.

3. Extreme Programming (XP): A software development methodology that emphasizes communication, simplicity, and feedback. It involves pair programming, frequent releases, and automated testing.

4. Lean: A methodology that emphasizes maximizing value and minimizing waste. It involves continuous improvement, value stream mapping, and eliminating activities that do not add value.

Overall, Agile methodologies prioritize collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement to ensure that the end product meets customer needs and is delivered in a timely and efficient manner.
