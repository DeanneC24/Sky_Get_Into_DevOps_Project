Summary of Python History:

Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer.
The first version of Python was released in 1991.
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be possible in other languages, such as C++ or Java.
Python has a large standard library, which provides support for many common programming tasks such as web development, data analysis, and scientific computing.
Python's popularity has grown rapidly in recent years, with many large companies such as Google and Facebook using Python for a wide range of applications.

What is Python Used for in Software Coding:

Python is used for a wide range of software coding tasks, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more.
Python is a popular language for building web applications using frameworks such as Django or Flask.
Python is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis, with popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.
Python is also used for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, with libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
Python is often used in conjunction with other languages, such as C++ or Java, for performance-critical tasks.
