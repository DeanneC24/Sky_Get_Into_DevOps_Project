 Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in software code over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project and keep track of changes made by each developer.

 Here are some of the most common Git commands and their meanings:

1.  git init: initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

2.  git clone: copies a Git repository from a remote source to your local machine.

3.  git add: adds changes to the staging area, preparing them for a commit.

4.  git commit: saves changes to the local repository.

5.  git push: uploads local changes to a remote repository.

6.  git pull: downloads changes from a remote repository to your local machine.

7.  git branch: lists all the branches in the repository.

8 . git checkout: switches to a different branch.

9.  git merge: combines changes from one branch into another.

10. git status: shows the current status of the repository and any changes that need to be committed.

These are just a few of the most commonly used Git commands, but there are many more available. With Git, you can manage your code efficiently and collaborate effectively with other developers.
