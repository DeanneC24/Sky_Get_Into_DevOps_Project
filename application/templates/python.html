<p>Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer. Apparently named after Monty Python's Flying Circus!
The first version of Python was released in 1991. <p>
    <b></b>
    <p>It is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be possible in other languages, such as C++ or Java.
Python has a large standard library, which provides support for many common programming tasks such as web development, data analysis, and scientific computing.
Python's popularity has grown rapidly in recent years, with many large companies such as Google and Facebook using Python for a wide range of applications.
